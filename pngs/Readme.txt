This folder contains PNGs (Portable Network Graphics) of our logos.

There are three folders here;
96 DPI
300 DPI
600 DPI

The higher the DPI number, the larger and higher quality the image is. The file sizes grossly expand for each DPI level. As such, 96 DPI should usually be used, except when you need the logos to be large-form, or be edited.
